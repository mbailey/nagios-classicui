Nagios Classic UI
=================

After more than a decade, Nagios replaced its familiar web UI with
a new one. I hate the new one and wanted the old one back.

Installation
------------

    cd /usr/share/nagios # or wherever your Nagios is installed
    git clone https://github.com/mbailey/nagios-classicui.git html
